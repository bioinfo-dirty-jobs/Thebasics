## Welcome!

Welcome to this introductory course about _NGS data analysis_. During this course you will learn the basics of NGS data analysis in a Linux environment, current used software and best practices will be explained.
This course is focused in NGS data alignment for both DNA and RNA (RNA-seq), variant calling, differential expression analysis and data visualization.
This is course is scheduled for a 2 days and assumes a very basic knowledge of NGS data analysis and Linux.
All materials in this is course are free and open and derived from some pulic avaible online course.

### Learning outcomes

After this course you should be able to:

- Start to move on linux system 
- Know the precincipal formats  use on  NGS 
- Evaluate quality and clean fastq 
- Map and visualize some alignment
- Know some base of analisys

- You will (probably) not come away being an expert
- We cannot teach you everything about NGS data
    + plus, it is a fast-moving field
    + will cover a selection of tools / methods
- However, we hope that you will
    + Understand how your data are processed
    + Be able to explore your data - no programming required
    + Understand the issues and compromises involved in current methods
    + Communicate more effectively with the Bioinformaticians dealing with your data
    + Increase confidence with R and Bioconductor and linux system
    + Know where to get help
    + Be able to explore new technologies, methods, tools as they come out
    + Have fun!
- The software used will also be available to you
    + more on this soon


and you will be exposed to these software:


- [FASTQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
- [SAMTOOLS](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html)
- [bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [bwa](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
- [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)
- [multiQC](http://multiqc.info/)
- [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)
- [vt](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Vt)
- [freebays](https://github.com/ekg/freebayes)
- [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/)
- [NEXTFLOW](https://www.nextflow.io/)
- [KALLISTO](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about)
- [SLEUTH](https://github.com/pachterlab/sleuth)
- [picards](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/)

NGS data can be big, very big, huge! Biology is now a Big Data science
There are not many web-based or graphical applications to perform analysis yet, sorry.
Most tools developed to work on Linux, many command line programs
How to work in NGS?
- Small datasets (<1TB): workstations
- Medium sized datasets (<100TB): clusters
- Big datasets (100TB-20PB): big clusters and/or cloud based solutions

Exercises during this course the NGS alignment will be done using the human chromosome 21 or MT as a reference genome. By doing this we can speed up exercises and avoid using too much memory. Under real circumstances, when using the standard reference genome, all the commands are exactly the same.
Software has been already installed to save time, so you are not expected to download and install all the software it is going to be used. However, it's usually good to learn the basics of software installation in Linux, there is an optional session at the end of the first day for those that want to learn how to install NGS software in a standard Linux. We use conda for install most of the tools.

### We assume you are familiar with:

- Next generation sequencing in general
- Be patient
- Please see this video [How to sequence the human genome - Mark J. Kiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvuYATh7Y74)

> To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of.‚Äù. R.A. Fisher, 1938

If you haven't designed your experiment properly, then all the Bioinformatics we teach you won't help: Consult with your local statistician - preferably **not the day before your grant is due!!!!**
